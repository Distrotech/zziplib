The XML is no feature as a kind of "generates it". Instead you can
markup your "htm" text with some xhtml markups. 

Additionally, some xhtml markups are converted docbook xml while
other docbook xml tags are being cleaned away when generating a
html target - most prominently any "<section>" tags around article
parts. You need to write them down explicitly.

That mode allows to generated html and xml from the same sources.
Additionally the xml sitefile is now an xml masterdocbook. You
should be able to just compile the xml masterdocbook file to get
a full xml docbook that can be converted to other targets like pdf.
