<H4> How to get... meta variables </H4>

<publisher>Guido Draheim</publisher>

<P>
  Just have a look the generated "*.html" files - you will see that
  the mksite.sh script has already generated a series of &lt;meta&gt;
  tags in the header block. Most of these automatic variables will
  pick up the names of the "Dublic Core" ontology of meta
  information which is a real internet standard. Some search engines
  like google may pick that information to enhance their results.

<PRE>
&lt;meta name="formatter" content="mksite.sh" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="DC.title" content="How to get... meta variables" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="DC.relation.isFormatOf" content="tutorial9.htm" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="DC.date.modified" content="2004-10-12" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="DC.date" content="2004-10-12" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="DC.relation.section" content="index.html" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="DC.title.selected" content=" (9)" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="DC.publisher" content="guidod" /&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
  It is possible to add more such meta variables by adding pieces to
  your content text. Just mark them up with then name of the Dublin
  Core give it as markup. So, in order to override the "DC.publisher"
  and the "DC.date" you would add these two lines somewhere in your
  content text: <PRE>
    &lt;publisher&gt;Guido Draheim&lt;/publisher&gt;
    &lt;date&gt;2004-11-07&lt;/date&gt;
</PRE>

  That way one can memorize the last edit date in the document and
  also the last editor of the document. The automatic values would
  be the last modification time of the source file in the file
  system for edit date and the current login user as the being the 
  publisher. This is mostly correct for home pages but it would be
  not if you share some doc files with collegues.

<P>
  The list of current DC values is as follows:  <PRE>
       contributor date source language coverage identifier
       rights relation creator subject description
       publisher DCMIType
</PRE>
  and a lot of these can take subcategories - the "date" parameter
  can also be subdivided into "DC.date.issued", "DC.date.modified",
  "DC.date.available", "DC.date.created" - and you can set each of
  these by adding the subcategory inside the text with a colon-prefix
  like this:<PRE>
    &lt;date&gt;created:2004-11-07&lt;/date&gt;
    &lt;relation&gt;isCopyOf:OtherPage.html&lt;/relation&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
   None of these meta-tags will be copied as text content - they are
   removed during generation of the content block, so they will be
   only set as meta-variables in the header block.
