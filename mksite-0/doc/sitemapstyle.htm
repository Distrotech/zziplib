<H3>sitemapstyle = selecting generator for sitemap file</H3>

<PRE><b>
   &lt;!--mksite:listsitemapstyle--&gt; </b>
   &lt;!--mksite:multisitemapstyle--&gt; 
</PRE>
<P>
  The option can be selected in the sitefile, per default we do
  use <code>mksite:listsitemapstyle</code>. 
  <code>&lt;!--mksite:multi--&gt;</code> 
  will select <code>mksite:multisitemapstyle</code> as well.
</P>
<P>
 The sitemap file is always generated into the target variant of
 the sitefile - if your sitefile is named "site.htm" then the
 sitemap will generated into "site.html". To make this happen
 the target sitemap file must be named in the sitefile as a
 generation html file. To stick with the example, in your
 file "site.htm" the following line should be present:
<PRE>
&lt;br&gt;-&lt;a href="site.html"&gt;our sitemap&lt;/a&gt.
</PRE>
<P>
 Note that there may be multiple sitefiles for a website and
 each will get its own sitemap. The sitemap is really just a
 conversion of the sect/subsect hierarchy present in the
 sitefile that you did create for your website. Most styles
 for a sitemap will present each sect1/ sect2/... entry 
 sligthly differently.
</P>
<P>
 In the <code>listsitemapstyle</code> each sect/subsect
 entry is presented in a linear list top-down. The order 
 matches exactly the order of html targets in the sitefile.
 Each sect1 is prefixed by "*", each sect2 is prefixed by
 a "-", and each sect3 is slightly indented, i.e. prefixed with
 a "&nbsp;" and has also added some dots or a hyphen to mark its
 relation to the nexthigher topic entry. Here is an example:
</P>
<center><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
 <tr><td>*</td> <td><a href="examples.html">examples</a></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><small>2004-04-22 </small></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><em>Examples of sitefiles</em></td></tr>

 <tr><td>-</td> <td><a href="horizontal.html"> horizontal</a></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><small>2004-04-22 </small></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><em>Horizontal Navigation Bar</em></td></tr>
 <tr><td>-</td> <td><a href="vertical.html"> vertical</a></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><small>2004-04-22 </small></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><em>Vertical Navigation Bar</em></td></tr>

 <tr><td>-</td> <td><a href="tabbed.html"> tabbed</a></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><small>2004-04-22 </small></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><em>Tabbed Vertical Navigation Bar</em></td></tr>
 <tr><td> </td> <td><a href="tabbed2.html">-  (2)</a></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><small>2004-04-22 </small></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><em><em>new</em> Tabbed Vertical Navigation Bar</em></td></tr>

 <tr><td>-</td> <td><a href="multi.html"> multi section</a></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><small>2004-04-22 </small></td><td>&nbsp;</td> <td><em>Multi Section Vertical Navigation Bar</em></td></tr>
</table></center>
<P>
  As seen in example, the listsitemapstyle presents each page with (a) the 
  shorthand name taken from the sitefile along with the href hotlink from
  the sitefile (b) attach the date meta attribute from that file being
  usually the last modified one (c) and put in the title attribute of
  the target page which is often the first <code>&lt;H2&gt;</code> or
  similar markup in the text body of the source.
</P>

  This style can be too long for some occassions. The multisitemapstyle
  uses a more compact notation. There the three entries are set together
  in table cell. The sitemap table itself has as many columns as there 
  are sect1 section entries, and each column starts off with the sect1
  intro page reference. Obsiously this mode has been developed for being
  used along with the multi<a href="sectionstyle">sectionstyle</a>
  layout for the website.
</P>
<P>
  It turns out that the multisitemapstyle is really more compact but
  it also makes reading it a lot harder. While many sites will pick up
  the multisectionstyle quite early in the process (at about 30-80 pages)
  it occurred that the listsitemapstyle looks better than the 
  multisitemapstyle for about 100 pages. For newer code it therefore
  recommended to use the listsitemapstyle along with a multisectionstyle.
</P>
<P>
  Since a sitemap of 100 entries in the list might be hard to read as
  well (by the amount of entries) the reader of this site is asked to
  develop some sitemapstyle for the 40-100 range and send it to me. The
  current multisitemapstyle layout is not all too pleasing to my eyes
  and therefore not explicitly shown in this feature documentation. If
  you want to see it then just enable it with the 
   <code>&lt;!--mksite:multisitemapstyle--&gt;</code> option in the sitefile 
  and have look. Patches <em>are</em> welcome.
