  The option can be selected in the sitefile, per default we do
  expand direct comment variables.  &lt;!--mksite:nocommentvars--&gt; 
  disables this feature as well.

   input: some <code>&lt;!--$varname--&gt;</code> text
  output: some value text
 default: some  text

   input: section <code>&lt;!--$varname?--&gt;</code> !
  output: section - text !
  output: section (text) !
</PRE>
<P>
   This is the preferred method of expanding variables. They are
   invisible in the source htm file. They add some text to the
   result. The variant expansions can be selected via "?" after
   the variable name. The variant is usually (a) hyphenated for
   toplevel variables or (b) parenthesed for secondary variables.
</P>
<P>
   A toplevel variable is "DC.title" and "DC.author" that can be
   selected as "$title" and "$author". The secondary variable 
   are usually those of "DC.date", e.g. "DC.date.modified" and
   "DC.date.issued" that can be selected as "$modified" and
   "$issued".
</P>
<P>
   The specification of variants stems from times when there was
   no complex expansion of variables available that would allow
   additional formatting within the comment box. Therefore the
   most common formatting was done in the mksite.sh script. The
   variant expansions have survived can still be used.
