  The option can be selected in the sitefile, per default we do
  expand direct comment variables.  &lt;!--mksite:nocommentvars--&gt; 
  disables this feature as well.

   This is the preferred method of expanding variables. They are
   invisible in the source htm file. They add some text to the
   result. The variant expansions can be selected via "?" after
   the variable name. The variant expansion has always (a) the
   lowercased variant of the original value and (b) any markup
   removed from the original value. That makes it most usueful
   to be pasted into <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag contents.
</P>
<P>
   The <em>direct<em> usage of the variant name (without even
   some whitspace inside the comment markup) makes for an
   additional modification where the variant is usually (a) hyphenated 
   for toplevel variables or (b) parenthesed for secondary variables.
   The toplevel variables are "DC.title" and "DC.author" that can be
   selected as "$title" and "$author". The secondary variables 
   are usually those of "DC.date", e.g. "DC.date.modified" and
   "DC.date.issued" that can be selected as "$modified" and
   "$issued".

   The specification of variants stems from times when there was
   no complex expansion of variables available that would allow
   additional formatting within the comment box. See the
   <a href="simplevars.html">simplevars</a> for those. Therefore 
   the most common formatting was done in the mksite.sh script
   making for the usual editing of those values. The variant 
   expansions have survived can still be used in that mode and
   make sometimes for a little shorter input text, e.g. for
   <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> content specs.
