<H3> printerfriendly = printer / text mode version </H3>

  This is the recommended sitefile snippet to enable the mode that will
  generate a printerfriendly sister page for <em>all</em> pages also
  generated by the <code>mksite.sh</code> script from "*.htm" to "*.html".
  In this case it is actually generated from "*.htm" to "*.print.html".
  The stem extension for the sister pages can be set via the magic setting 
  of course - the default is ".print" which is the same as choosing it
  explicitly with...

  The actual inner mechanics will create a sister sitefile for the
  printerfriendly mode with the stem extension - if your sitefile was
  named "site.htm" (the default) then the printersitefile would be
  named "site.print.htm" (as per defaults). This printersitefile contains
  definitions for horizontal navigation bars created out of the information
  for the access tree as given in the original sitefile. Those horizontal
  bars reflect the sect/subsect relations in a way most usable form for
  being navigated with a text mode browser (e.g. lynx).

  Note how there are little squares in the graphical view (if you look at 
  this page with a graphical browser) while these get replaced with some 
  alt-texts for a textmode browser. These alt-texts simply hint for the
  sect/subsect relation (<code>section</code> to <code>topics:</code> to <code>pages:</code>) but the first entry
  is slightly different - it is named <code>go text:</code> and the hot
  link under it will jump down to right after the header navigation block 
  (here: lorem ipsum).
</P>
<P>
  That variant is recommended by <a href="waicheck.html">WAI</a> texts
  to help blind people to read the text with a text-to-speech machine
  or a braille terminal i.e. purely linear starting with the first word
  on the page. There it is best to have a first hotlink on the page that 
  should help to skip down to the main body text, and it should bear a caption
  saying just that (like "skip down to text". I hope that "go text:"
  is identifying this functionality as well. In fact the hot link under
  "go text:" skips to "#." - and we have generated a little anchor in
  the print.html text as <code>&lt;a&nbsp;name="."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
</P>
<P>
  The hotlink under the second img-square (replaced by "topics:" in the
  text mode view) points back to the normal sitefile representation for
  colored graphical browsers. It would be best if there is a link to
  the text mode version in the graphical sitefile represention. And it
  is recommended to give it the very same look of the generated little
  img-squares in the print.html view. That's where the recommendation
  comes from as shown at the top of this page - to make a little
   <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> with no "src=" and size of 8x8. The very
  same thing generated into the "*.print.html" header block.
</P>
<P>
  In the normal graphical sitefile representation you should use two
  textuals around the hotlink to the "$printerfriendly" version.
  - The alt-text replacement of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
  tag is only seen with text mode browsers, so we let it read as
  <em>"(go to) printer / text mode version"</em> (it is a hot link
  by the surrounding <code>&lt;a&nbsp;href&gt;</code>). For the
  surrounding href we set an "title=" attribute however - modern
  browsers will present it as a little (yellow) popup text when
  hovering the mouse pointer over it. Here we set the hint for a
  functionality most useful to people with a graphical browsers, it
  says <em>"(go to) printer friendly version"</em>. That's because
  the generated "*.print.html" has less colors and no big shadowed
  navigation bar.
</P>
<P>
  Note that our printerfriendly mode is clever enough to replace
  all hrefs in the header lines and the body text with hrefs to
  the "*.print.html" version generated. So when all your crafted
  htm(l) files are listed in the sitefile then a user with a text 
  mode browser will never leave the text mode oriented mode when
  clicking on a (website internal) hotlink. It will always end on
  the sister "*.print.html" variant.
