<H3> ...and it works </H3>

<P>
  On the <a href="how.html">prior page</a> we were presenting a
  simple sitemap file to show how to tell MKSITE.SH which of the
  hrefs are entries that it shall process from "*.htm" source
  into a "*.html" file with full navigation and meta tags. It
  was not complete for the usual navigation bar going vertically
  on the left side of a browser view - so here is a complete
  example:
</P>
<pre>
  &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;common title prefix &lt;!--title?--&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
   a:link          { text-decoration : none ; color : #000080 ; }
   a:visited       { text-decoration : none ; color : #200060 ; }
   .navi           { background-color : #E0E0FF ; }
  &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;table class="navi" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" width="100%"&gt;
  &lt;tr valign="top"&gt;&lt;td width="140"&gt;
  &lt;hr&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;-&lt;a href="intro.html"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;-&lt;a href="where.html"&gt;Downloads&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;hr&gt;&lt;a href="doc.html"&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;-&lt;a href="man.html"&gt;Manual Page&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;-&lt;a href="ref.html"&gt;Cross References&lt;/a&gt;
       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;a href="impressum.html"&gt;Impressum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;hr&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="site.html"&gt;sitemap&lt;/a&gt; &lt;hr&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<P>
  The MKSITE.SH will see six files to be potentionally to be converted
  where the HR[] denotes the sect1 categories - and whereas the BR[-] lines
  with an additional designator char point to the sect2 subcategorized
  pages. The last "impressum" line is not seen as its line does start
  off with additional whitespace.
</P>
<P>
  The sect1/sect2 relation is not important for a simple sitefile like
  shown above, here just treat all hrefs as navigation pointers as such. The
  sect1/sect2 relation will get important when you enable the multi-view
  which is simply done by putting a &lt;!--mksite:multi--&gt; hint somewhere
  in the sitefile (on its own line). Suddenly you will get two different
  navigation bar looks where one will only show entries under "Overview"
  and the other only entries under "Documentation". Both generated
  navigation bar types will contain the "Impressum" link.
</P>
<P>
  If you enable the &lt;!--mksite:multi--&gt; view then the site.html sitemap
  file will also change into a multi-column layout. That allows to
  present a hundred files in a compact notation along with their long
  title as has been parsed out from those *.htm source files. It is
  also an easy way for a developer to get an overview whether all pages
  are present that she did want to show to the user - and to know the
  subject lines as would be listed by <a href="http://google.com">google</a>.
</P>
<P>
  Note that you can customize the sect1/sect2 relations easily - simply
  edit the mksite.sh that you ship with your project. Look for series
  of "echo"s to ".gets.tmp" somewhere around the middle of the script.
  The "sect1/sect2/sect3" relations are very explicit there and later
  steps will be always using those annotations.
</P>
<P>
  And if you are keen on the tab-like multi-column layout of this
  webpage then be informed that this is simply a longer sitefile
  that usual - there are no functional differences for that in the
  MKSITE.SH script. It is just that MKSITE.SH will look for lines
  containing a "href" to one of its generated pages. If it does find
  such then it will put B'bold marks around the current page and
  kill a "class=" hint from a TD'mark containing the section name of
  the current page.
</P>
<P>
  In other words, there is no <b>magic</b> in here. The MKSITE.SH is very
  short and I did try to make it easy to read - so you can easily
  derive your own version to ship along with your project sources.
  It would be nice if you'd inform me of your changes so that I can
  profit of your ideas just as you did from mine.
</P>
